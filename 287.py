287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer 
is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only 
constant extra space.
